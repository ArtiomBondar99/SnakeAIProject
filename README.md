AI-Based Snake Game Project (Python, Pygame, NEAT, NumPy, Q-Learning, A*)
Developed an AI-enhanced version of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame framework for rendering and game loop management. Integrated
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
to evolve neural networks that adapt over generations. Used
Q-Learning
to train the agent to make efficient decisions based on environmental feedback and past experience. Implemented
A* algorithm
for optimal pathfinding while dynamically avoiding obstacles (bombs) added after each successful move. Leveraged
NumPy
for matrix operations and state representation, and used
pickle
for saving/loading training data and models.
